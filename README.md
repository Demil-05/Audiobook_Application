# Audiobook Application
--------------------
## Python application for reading PDF or text files out loud.
--------------------
This application makes use of the Python tkinter module to create a simple but attractive UI.
Users can select a file from their local machines to read out loud and have the option of saving the
audio file locally as well. This way, they can always come back to listen to it. The option of selecting 
the properties of the speech like the voice, volume, and speed of the audio is also made possible here.
